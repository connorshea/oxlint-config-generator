TODO:

- [ ] Move the Options and Plugins sections into a top set of cards, above the rules list and generated config.
- [ ] Organize the plugins selector into sections (Default, Frameworks, Testing, Misc.)
- [ ] Add a toggle to switch to a full rules list (still filtered by the plugins you have enabled, but with rule text search and a filter for whether the rule is autofixable)
- [ ] Allow filtering the rules by text search.
- [ ] Get vitest rules from the jest plugin to show up and work correctly.
- [ ] Fix the alignment of the helper text under the checkboxes for Options.
- [ ] Add a CI job to automatically regenerate the rule descriptions JSON every Monday and open a PR.
- [ ] Add a note with the oxlint version used for the ruleset in the footer.
- [ ] Add a button to add JS Plugins from a select set of them (e.g. eslint-plugin-playwright, eslint-plugin-testing-library, @stylistic/eslint-plugin, eslint-plugin-storybook, etc.)
- [ ] Make the "Copy" button float over the generated config box, so it's always visible.
- [ ] Add JSON syntax highlighting to the generated config box.
- [ ] Update the rule descriptions to parse Markdown backticks and use code blocks.
