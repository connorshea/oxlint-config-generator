Create a basic static website in this repo using Vue and Vite that allows users to create an Oxlint config file.

Oxlint is a linter for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It is written in Rust and has ported many of the rules from ESLint and popular ESLint plugins.

## The website should have the following features

- Buttons to pick which plugins to potentially use rules from, see the oxc.rs docs for the full list of supported plugins.
- A button for whether or not to enable type-aware rules. The rules.json file says whether rules are type-aware or not.
- A button to generate the `.oxlintrc.json` file based on the selected options.
- A display area to show the generated `.oxlintrc.json` JSON file with a copy button.

# Scripts to generate data files

We want to use generated JSON files to power the website and track data about rules. These JSON files can come from the oxc project or be generated by us from evaluating ESLint plugins, etc.

- A script for generating the `rules.json` file (can be pulled from the `oxc-project/oxc-project.github.io` repository, https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc-project.github.io/blob/main/.vitepress/data/rules.json)
- A script for generating JSON files for each of the original ESLint plugins that Oxlint is based on (eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-promise, etc).
- The JSON file should show which rules are recommended from each original ESLint plugin (and eslint itself). We will need to install the plugins as dev dependencies in order to determine this.
- See the `tasks/lint_rules/src/eslint-rules.mjs` file at https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/blob/main/tasks/lint_rules/src/eslint-rules.mjs for an example of how to get this info.

## Tools to use:

- Use Node.js.
- Use pnpm as the package manager
- Use oxlint as the linter for the project
- Use TypeScript
- Use Vue 3 with Vite for the static website.
- Use oxfmt as the formatter.

## The goal workflow is like this:

- The user visits the website.
- The user selects which ESLint plugins they want to include rules from (React, JSX A11y, Vue, Vitest, Jest, etc.)
- The user selects whether or not to enable type-aware rules.
- The user is given the option to use the recommended rulesets from each original ESLint plugin, and the Oxlint rules are selected accordingly.
- The user then clicks a button to generate the Oxlint config file (`.oxlintrc.json`), displayed inside the website with a copy button.

After that, the user can copy the generated config file and use it in their project. Or the user can select rules to add or remove from the generated config file.

I want to host it on GitHub Pages as a static website, but for now just make it work for local development.

## Other notes

The oxlint config file should be in JSON format.

The docs for Oxlint are available at https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.md

You can use the JSON Schema to figure out what a `.oxlintrc.json` file looks like: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxc-project/oxc/main/npm/oxlint/configuration_schema.json

Note that the "categories" should not be configurable. The "correctness" category should be set to "off" to avoid enabling these by default. A `$schema` field should always be included which has a string value of "./node_modules/oxlint/configuration_schema.json".

Use modern web best practices, and only ESM imports, no `require()`. Everything should be in TypeScript. Use Vue 3 with the Composition API.
